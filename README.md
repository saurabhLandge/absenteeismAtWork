# Predicting reason of Absenteeism At Work

### Introduction
This project covers full lifecycle of Big Data and training of a Machine Learning Model to predict the reason of absence for a courier company in Brazil. We have also evaluated the 
performance, scalability, fault tolerance and reliability of the Machine Leanring Model.

### Objective
- To predict reason for absenteeism by training the ML Model
- To use different ML Algorithms to train the model thereby comparing their accuracy scores: Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost
- To visualise the relation between criterias and number of hours of absenteeism for employees

### Dataset 
- The dataset was created over a period of 3 years from 2007 to 2010
- The dataset is from a courier company in Brazil
- The original Authors of the Dataset are Andrea Martiniano(1), Ricardo Pinto Ferreira(2) and Renato Jose Sassi(3) and can be collected from [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/445/absenteeism+at+work)
- There are 21 categories of Diseases, & other metrics that may be a factor to absenteeism of the Employees such as
  -  Date of their absence
  -  Weather / Season
  -  Transportation expense they pay
  -  Distance they travel for work
  -  Time they have been in service
  -  Their Age
  -  Work Load
  -  Disciplinary Failure or not
  -  Education level
  -  Number of children they have
  -  Whether they are social drinker
  -  Whether they are social smoker
  -  Number of pets they have
  -  Height, weight, BMI


### Tools used 
- Pandas : Works well with tabular data. Used for Visualisation
- Numpy : Used for array operations
- SKlearn : Used for Machine Learning algorithms
- matplotlib : for Visualisation

### Outcome
- Most common reason for absenteeism is infectious diseases, diseases of circulatory system, digestive system, disease of muscuskeletal system and injury.
-  We have visualised absenteeism time in hours to various reasons of absense
